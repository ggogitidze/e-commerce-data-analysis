    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "4. Data Visualization\n",
    "5. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "6. Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from kaggle: \"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervemenekse/ecommerce-dataset/data#\".\n",
    "\n",
    " The dataset includes information about customer orders, product details, sales transactions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSV File:** `E-commerce_Dataset.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning was performed using Python and SQLite in DBeaver. The steps involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the dataset:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    file_path = 'E-commerce_Dataset.csv'\n",
    "    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle missing values:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove duplicates:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import cleaned data into SQLite using DBeaver.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA was performed to understand user behavior patterns using Python and visualized in Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demographics and Order Insights:**\n",
    "    - Gender distribution, device type usage, aging analysis.\n",
    "2. **Sales and Profit Analysis:**\n",
    "    - Sales trends, profit margins, average order quantities.\n",
    "3. **Shipping and Order Priority:**\n",
    "    - Shipping costs by device type, average shipping costs by order priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses were tested using formal statistical practices, including null and alternative hypotheses, and steps for testing these hypotheses using Python for statistical analysis and Tableau for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hypothesis: Customers using mobile devices have a higher average order value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The average order value for customers using mobile devices is equal to the average order value for customers using web devices.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The average order value for customers using mobile devices is not equal to the average order value for customers using web devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Average Order Value by Device Type:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    from scipy import stats\n",
    "\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpret Results:**\n",
    "    - If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize in Tableau:**\n",
